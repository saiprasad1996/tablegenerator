# TableGenerator
I always find difficulty in generate a table for an app documentation purposes and didn't find a simple and lightweight app to do the same. 
So I created this simple java based commandline app to perform this task.. 
You can find the source code for this app which is a single java source file which does it all. 

Feel free to mess around the source code and binary jar
